For the purposes of this challenge, we define a binary search tree to be a binary tree with the following ordering properties:

The  value of every node in a node's left subtree is less than the data value of that node.
The  value of every node in a node's right subtree is greater than the data value of that node.
Given the root node of a binary tree, can you determine if it's also a binary search tree?

Complete the function in your editor below, which has  parameter: a pointer to the root of a binary tree. It must return a boolean denoting whether or not the binary tree is a binary search tree. You may have to write one or more helper functions to complete this challenge.
