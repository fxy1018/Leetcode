'''
Given a binary search tree (See Definition) and a node in it, find the in-order successor of that node in the BST.
Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
Given tree = [2,1] and node = 1:
  2
 /
1
return node 2.
Given tree = [2,1,3] and node = 2:
  2
 / \
1   3
return node 3.
Note
If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return null.
Challenge
O(h), where h is the height of the BST.
