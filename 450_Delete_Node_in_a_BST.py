Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

Search for a node to remove.
If the node is found, delete the node.
Note: Time complexity should be O(height of tree).

Example:

root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
key = 3

    5
   / \
  3   6
 / \   \
2   4   7

Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.

One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the following BST.

    5
   / \
  4   6
 /     \
2       7

Another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7].

    5
   / \
  2   6
   \   \
    4   7


思路: recursion
Recursively find the node that has the same value as the key, while setting the left/right nodes equal to the returned subtree
Once the node is found, have to handle the below 4 cases
node doesn't have left or right - return null
node only has left subtree- return the left subtree
node only has right subtree- return the right subtree
node has both left and right - find the minimum value in the right subtree, set that value to the currently found node, then recursively delete the minimum value in the right subtree
Complexity:O(lgN -- height of tree).
