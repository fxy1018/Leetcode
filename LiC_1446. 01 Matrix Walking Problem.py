'''
Given an 01 matrix gird of size n*m, 1 is a wall, 0 is a road, now you can turn a 1 in the grid into 0, Is there a way to go from the upper left corner to the lower right corner? If there is a way to go, how many steps to take at least?

Example
Given a = [[0,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0],[1,1,0,1,0],[1,1,1,1,0]]ï¼Œreturn 7.

Explanation:
Change `1` at (0,1) to `0`, the shortest path is as follows:
(0,0)->(0,1)->(0,2)->(0,3)->(0,4)->(1,4)->(2,4)->(3,4) There are many other options of length `7`, not listed here.
Given a = [[0,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]], return -1.

Explanation:
Regardless of which `1` is changed to `0`, there is no viable path.
